# Locl CLI

Dev tools to help you with `$localize` and Angular i18n.

## Installation

Install the cli tools with npm:

```sh
npm install @locl/cli --save-dev
```

## Usage

You can get a full list of commands with `npx locl --help`.

### Extraction

You can use `locl extract` to extract translations from your ivy application:

```
npx locl extract -s=dist/apps/demo/*.js -f=json -o=dist/i18n/en.json
```

The extraction tool will find any call to `$localize` within your bundle files (in code and in templates),
but there is a limitation inherent to the way Angular files are generated by the compiler:
**you need to build your application with the AOT mode to generate template translations using `$localize`.**
Always use `--prod` or `--aot` when you build your application. Also make sure to not build for a specific language. 

#### Options:

- `--source` (`-s`): A glob pattern indicating what files to search for translations, e.g. `./dist/**/*.js`. This can be absolute or relative to the current working directory.
- `--format` (`-f`): the format of the translation file to generate. Either `xlf`, `xlf2`, `xmb` or `json`.
- `--outputPath` (`-o`): A path to where the translation file will be written. This can be absolute or relative to the current working directory. If the given path is a file, it will aggregate the translations of all the source files into one translation file. Otherwise it will generate one translation file per file parsed.
- `--locale` (`-l`): The locale for the extracted file, "en" by default.

### Conversion

You can use `locl convert` to convert translations from one format to another:

```
npx locl convert -s=dist/i18n/fr.xlf -f=json -o=dist/i18n/fr.json
```

The conversion tool will read all translation files from the source glob and generate a file of the specified format at the specified output path.

Since the source glob can be used to take multiple files as input, it is possible to use this tool to aggregate multiple translation files into one:

```
npx locl convert -s=dist/i18n/*.xlf -f=json -o=dist/i18n/fr.json
```

It is recommended to use this tool to convert your files to json if you want to lazy load the translations at bootstrap,
since it is the only format that is supported by the existing loaders, and it is the most optimized one in terms of size.

#### Options:

- `--source` (`-s`): A glob pattern indicating what files to convert, e.g. `./assets/**/*.xlf`. This can be absolute or relative to the current working directory. Only translation files are supported (json, xtb & xlf but not xmb).
- `--format` (`-f`): The format of the translation files to generate. Either `xlf`, `xlf2`, `xtb` or `json`.
- `--outputPath` (`-o`): A path to where the translation file will be written. This can be absolute or relative to the current working directory.
